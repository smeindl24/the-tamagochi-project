# the-tamagochi-project

Hello! My name is Sebastian Meindl and I am a rising senior at USF. Currently enrolled in the university's Introduction to Python class, this repo will encapsulate my final project for the class.

The project in question is to create, from start to finish, a tamagochi-esque program that utilizes small coded creatures for purposes of education and enrichment. Some features will include: 
  >> A custom sprite and background 
  >> UI Integration
  >> Memory Storage
  >> Library and Asset Management
  >> And More!

I hope you enjoy this project!
